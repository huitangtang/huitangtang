## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering](https://ece.hkust.edu.hk/) at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/), a core member in Prof. [Xiaomeng Li](https://xmengli.github.io/)'s Lab. I received my Ph.D. degree in the [Geometric Perception and Intelligence Research Lab (Gorilla Lab)](https://github.com/Gorilla-Lab-SCUT) at [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/), advised by Prof. [Kui Jia](http://kuijia.site/). Before that, I received my B.E. degree majoring in [Information Engineering](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/ee/) at [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/).

My research interests include deep learning, pattern recognition, computer vision, medical image analysis, and healthcare prediction. I am particularly focused on advancing methodologies and techniques in transfer learning, domain adaptation, semi-supervised learning, clustering, data synthesis, large models, etc.

I actively serve as a reviewer for numerous prestigious conferences and journals, including CVPR, ICCV, AAAI, NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ICME, TIP, TNNLS, JBHI, ESWA, PR, NEUNET, NEUCOM, and TMLR, among others.
